# Quickstarts

Each API has a Quickstart section that can be used with just Metamask or [Cast by Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cast/). If you are looking for a repo which you can clone and run locally, check out [Hyperlane Quickstart GitHub](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-quickstart/).&#x20;

### Messaging&#x20;

Hyperlane makes interchain communication straightforward by providing a simple on-chain API for sending and receiving messages.

Send your first message in under 5 minutes with our [Messaging Quickstart](quickstart-tutorial.md).

### Interchain Accounts

With Hyperlane, you can make a simple call via Interchain Accounts to a pre-deployed [`TestRecipient`](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/solidity/core/contracts/test/TestRecipient.sol) contract on a remote destination chain.&#x20;

Try it here with the [ICA Quickstart](quickstart-tutorial-2.md).

### Interchain Queries

Query any contract, not just `IMessageRecipient`s with the `handle()` function (even legacy contracts!).&#x20;

Make a view call in moments using `TestQuerySender` and the [IQS Quickstart](quickstart-tutorial-3.md).

### Sending Tokens

You've sent messages with Hyperlane; now it's time to bring value into the mix.&#x20;

Send tokens alongside messages with our [Liquidity Layer API Quickstart](quickstart-tutorial-1.md).
