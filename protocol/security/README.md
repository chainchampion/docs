# Security

The Hyperlane messaging API is secured by two [complementary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense\_in\_depth\_\(computing\)) protocols.

### Proof of stake

Hyperlane validators are secured by a delegated [proof-of-stake](proof-of-stake.md) protocol. Proof-of-stake provides **economic security**, ensuring that there is an economic cost to censorship or falsification of messages.

### Sovereign consensus

[Sovereign consensus](sovereign-consensus.md) allows applications to configure and choose from a selection of security models. This allows risk to **remain siloed** between applications and for applications to tune trust assumptions to best fit their needs, all while **maximizing decentralization**.&#x20;
