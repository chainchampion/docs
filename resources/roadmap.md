# Roadmap

{% hint style="info" %}
The following roadmap is for informational purposes only and is subject to change.
{% endhint %}

## Hyperlane Beta

We have currently released Hyperlane's 'mainnet-beta'

**Security**

The beta release includes the first release of sovereign cosnensus!

For now, the relayers only support a Multisig ISM using ECDSA signatures. Future releases will include other ISM types, which may include optimistic ISMs, or multisig ISMs using aggregatable signatures.

Proof-of-stake and economic security is coming soon™️.

**Governance**

Hyperlane beta is governed by a multi-signature wallet controlled by Abacus Works. The Mailbox contracts are upgradable using transparent proxies.

**Agents**

The relayer is configurable with a whitelist that allows operators to specify which messages to relay. Future releases will allow relayers to accept payments on the origin chain for processing of messages on the destination chain.

**Networks**

The alpha version of Hyperlane is deployed to the following mainnets (with testnets in parentheses):

* Arbitrum (Goerli)
* Avalanche (Fuji)
* BNB (BSC testnet)
* Celo (Alfajores)
* Ethereum (Goerli)
* Optimism (Goerli)
* Polygon (Mumbai)
* Moonbeam (Moonbase alpha)

## Roadmap

_**ETA Q1 2023**_

* Relayer support for custom ISMs
* Additional ISM types
* Proof-of-stake (alpha)
* Expansion to non-EVM chain
