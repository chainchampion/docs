# What is Hyperlane?

The Hyperlane protocol provides an on-chain API for sending information between blockchains.

### Looking to integrate Hyperlane?

Check out the [getting started guide](developers/getting-started.md) for ABIs, code examples, contract addresses, and more.

### Want to learn more about the protocol?

Take a look at the [protocol docs](protocol/overview.md) to understand the Hyperlane protocol architecture and security model.

_**A quick note to prevent confusion**_: Hyperlane was originally named Abacus. For the time being you may encounter the name Abacus still referenced throughout the docs, github repos, and smart contracts.&#x20;
