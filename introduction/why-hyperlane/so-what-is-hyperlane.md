# So, what is Hyperlane?

Hyperlane is the modular interoperability platform empowering developers to build applications that can easily and securely communicate between multiple blockchains. We call these interchain applications.\
\
You should also know what Hyperlane is not. It is not another token bridge, it is a network between blockchains. Developers can leverage this network to build applications that can easily and securely interact between the blockchains within it, allowing them to serve users on any of those chains.\
\
Modular? Yes Modular. Hyperlane was built as a modular interoperability layer, with an architecture uniquely suited to the world of many smart contract environments, whether they are rollups (either generalized or app specific), appchains, and heterogenous layer 1 blockchains (monolithic or not). Hyperlane was purpose built with flexibility and future proofing in mind. We want developers who choose Hyperlane to feel assured that Hyperlane will evolve with their applications, and know that they won’t have to look for new options because they ‘outgrow’ the platform.

Note that Hyperlane can support any smart contract environment, and in the course of these docs the term blockchain or chain will be used where rollup or appchain are equally suitable.&#x20;
