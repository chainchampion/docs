# What are the benefits of Hyperlane?

There are a number of benefits to using Hyperlane, several of which stem from the differentiating features discussed [below](what-are-the-benefits-of-hyperlane.md#what-sets-it-apart), but before we get to them let's touch on more basic benefits.

The first of these is the ability to connect your applications across many blockchains. This allows users to interact with your application from the chain they already are based from. Reducing the amount of hoops they have to jump through just to get to your app. Its about abstracting away the complexity of navigating between chains, and letting you and your users simply focus on your app.

Apps that have already become successful on one chain and want to expand to another, or better yet have already deployed on another blockchain will benefit from Hyperlane. Until now, all new deployments were instance. You'd have a popular app on Ethereum, but outside of sharing your brand, how does a new deployment on Polygon benefit from the network effects you've built on Ethereum?&#x20;

Additionally, as an application, you could use Hyperlane as a smart router for execution, routing your messages to the most appropriate chain given the parameters you care about most. If you're optimizing for cost, you could route to the most cost effective chain at any point in time.&#x20;

But what about a blockchain? How can it benefit from Hyperlane? A Hyperlane deployment on a blockchain means every current and future application on that chain gets to accrue the aforementioned benefits. Additionally, chains can benefit from new traffic that would not have arrived if not for Hyperlane.&#x20;

What about rollups or appchains? As a rollup Hyperlane augments your native bridge to your L1, offering your developers a fast path option for asset transfers. More importantly, it offers them the ability to interoperate with other environments, including other rollups and other L1s outside of your existing ecosystem. Similarly all of these apply to an appchain.
