# Quickstarts

### Messaging&#x20;

Hyperlane makes interchain communication straightforward by providing a simple on-chain API for sending and receiving messages.

Send your first message in under 5 minutes with our [Messaging Quickstart](messaging-api/quickstart-tutorial.md).

### Interchain Accounts

With Hyperlane, you can make a simple call via Interchain Accounts to a pre-deployed [`TestRecipient`](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/solidity/core/contracts/test/TestRecipient.sol) contract on a remote destination chain.&#x20;

Try it here with the [ICA Quickstart](send/quickstart-tutorial.md).
