# Refunds

### Refunds

The provided IGP contracts will refund any overpayment to the `_refundAddress`. Overpayment is anything that exceeds the amount returned by the `quoteGasPayment` contract.

#### Reentrancy Risk

Note that refunding overpayment involves the IGP contract calling the `_refundAddress`, which can present a risk of [reentrancy](https://www.certik.com/resources/blog/3K7ZUAKpOr1GW75J2i0VHh-what-is-a-reentracy-attack) for your application. Special care should be made by callers to ensure they are not vulnerable to reentrancy exploits.

#### Unsuccessful Refunds

If a refund is unsuccessful, the `payForGas` call will revert.
