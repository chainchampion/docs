# Troubleshooting

As you navigate the interchain and beginning sending your first messages between blockchains, or better yet, build your first interchain application, you may run into some issues.&#x20;

We know it can be difficult to figure all of it out by yourself, so this section is to help you troubleshoot your issues so you can get right back on the Interchain Highway and onwards to your destination!



[Where is My Message](observability.md) is all about helping you observe where your messages are in their life cycle. Have they been properly delivered and executed? Are they stuck in flight? You'll get your answer there. Our interchain message explorer will be launched soon to make this process far easier, but for now, [this page](observability.md) will provide the tools you need to observe the state of your messages.
