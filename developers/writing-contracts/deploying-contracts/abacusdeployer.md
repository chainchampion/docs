# AbacusDeployer

`AbacusDeployer` helps manage the deployment of contracts across multiple chains. Abacus apps should extend a deployer to specifiy the needed types and implement any needed logic for deployment of their contracts.&#x20;

Developers must provide an implementation for `deployContracts` which describes the logic for deploying the application on a single chain. Developers building with the [Router](../router.md) pattern can extend `AbacusRouterDeployer`, which handles some Router-specific boilerplate.

Deployers will also need contract [Factories](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/contract/contract-factory/), which be defined manually or generated automatically by tooling like TypeChain (recommended).

```typescript
import { AbacusRouterDeployer, ChainName } from '@abacus-network/sdk';

class MyDeployer<Chain extends ChainName, MyConfig>
  extends AbacusRouterDeployer<Chain, MyContracts, MyFactories, MyConfig> { 
    function deployContracts(network: Networks, config: MyConfig) {
      // Custom contract deployment logic to goes here
      // This method is called once for each target chain
    }
}
```

For a simple, single contract app that extends the `Router` contract, it is sufficient to call the `deployRouter` method in the `deployContracts` implementation:

```typescript
  async deployContracts(chain: Chain, config: HelloWorldConfig) {
    const acm = this.core.getContracts(chain).abacusConnectionManager.address;
    const router = await this.deployRouter(chain, [], [acm]);
    return { router };
  }
```
