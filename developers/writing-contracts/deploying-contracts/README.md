description: Managing multi-chain contract deployments

# Deploying

The Abacus SDK contains utilities to facilitate deploying your contract(s) to multiple chains. This includes utilities for bytecode verification, contract upgradability patterns, and sanity checking deployments for consistency across chains

Two core classes will be relevant for this task: an `AbacusDeployer` and an `AbacusAppChecker`.

### [AbacusDeployer](abacusdeployer.md)

A utility for managing deployments to multiple supported chains.&#x20;

### [AbacusAppChecker](abacusappchecker.md)

A utility for querying contracts to 'check' they are deployed and functioning.
