# Abacus App Framework

The Abacus Application SDK helps developers create and manage applications built on top of interchain smart contracts.

### [Contract Interactions](contract-interaction.md)

The classes in the `@abacus-network/sdk` package help you manage and interact with contracts  on different networks. The `AbacusApp` class manages the contract collections. It can be extended and instantiated with artifacts generated by the deployment tooling.

### [MultiProvider](./#multiprovider)

App to chain communication is performed via ethers.js compatible [providers](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/providers/). To help manage providers for multiple chains, the SDK includes a `MultiProvider` utility.

### [Gas Estimation and Payment](gas.md)

Abacus allows users to pay for message processing on the destination chain using tokens from the origin chain. Use the `InterchainGasCalculator` utility for gas estimation of cross-chain messages.
