# Messaging API

Integrating with Abacus can be as simple as understanding two endpoints. These endpoints are the smart contract interface into sending and receiving messages to and from other blockchains.

To [send interchain messages, reference the `Outbox.dispatch` API](send.md).

To [receive interchain messages, implement the `IMessageRecipient.handle` interface.](receive.md)
